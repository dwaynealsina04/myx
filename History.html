                    <p>Beginnings (1960s)
Filipino pop songs mainly referred to songs popularized since the 1960s, especially those in the ballad form, by major commercial artists like Pilita Corrales, Nora Aunor, Basil Valdez, Freddie Aguilar and Rey Valera.</p>

<p>In the 1970s, singer-songwriters Ryan Cayabyab and José Mari Chan rose to fame by composing original English love songs alongside modern Tagalog songs. Pioneer pop groups in the same decade include Manila Sound groups APO Hiking Society and Hotdog.</p>

<p>Golden age of Filipino music
In the 1980s, disco group VST & Co. and pop icon Gary V. gave rise to dance-pop in the mainstream.</p>

<p>Prominence of pop-rock (mid-1990s to present)
The early to mid-1990s saw the emergence of a superstar pop-rock group, Eraserheads, considered by many nationals as a turning-point in the OPM music scene. In the wake of their success was the emergence of a string of influential bands such as Yano, Siakol, Parokya ni Edgar, Grin Department, Rivermaya, Moonstar 88 and Hungry Young Poets, each of which mixes the influence of a variety of pop and rock subgenres into their style.</p>

<p>Filipino rock continues to flourish at present with newer bands such as Hale, Cueshé, Sponge Cola, Chicosci, Kamikazee and Urbandub, and the emergence of the country's first virtual band, Mistula. Though only some of the spearheading bands are still fully intact, many old members have formed new bands such as Pupil, Sandwich and Bamboo. A few band members such as Kitchie Nadal, Barbie Almalbis and Rico Blanco have established steady solo careers.</p>

<p>Though rock bands have been dominating the mainstream since their commercialization in the '90s, pop acts were still regularly showcased in the live band scene. Pop bands Side A, True Faith, Neocolours, South Border and Freestyle popularized songs that clearly reflect the sentimental character of OPM pop. Solo belters and balladeers such as Regine Velasquez, Sharon Cuneta, Joey Albert and Martin Nievera had regular exposure on television and radio. Currently, notable soloists like Sarah Geronimo, Sheryn Regis, Mark Bautista, Erik Santos, Christian Bautista, Rachelle Ann Go and Josh Santana continue this trend, even though remakes of old OPM songs and covers of international English songs are dominant in their work. Popular acoustic acts like Nina, Juris (of MYMP) and Aiza Seguerra also prove the diversity of Filipino pop. R&B artists Kyla and Jay-R, as well as hip-hop acts Gloc-9 and Dice & K9 (Mobbstarr), remain steadfast despite less representation of their respective genres in the current industry.</p>

<p>Re-emergence of urban and dance-pop (2000s)
Local urban and dance-pop achieved little attention in the mainstream since their initial prominence in the 1980s and the 1990s, respectively.</p>

<p>From the early 2000s onwards, R&B soloists Kyla, Nina and Jay R began to achieve high media visibility despite less representation of the genre in the current industry. Kyla, in particular, gained much attention during this time as one of the pioneers of the contemporary R&B genre. With the success of her hit single "Hanggang Ngayon" which went on to win at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards, Kyla became the first and only Filipino female artist to win at the VMAs.</p>

<p>By 2006, solo act Amber, later followed by Young JV and O.N.E, hit the mainstream with original Filipino-American urban music.</p>

<p>Concurrently, beginning in 2002, local sexy dance groups SexBomb Girls, Viva Hot Babes, Gee Girls, J Brothers, D'Bodies and Masculados began to popularize novelty songs among the masses. With this and the beaming popularity of American group Pussycat Dolls at the time, an interest emerged in forming American-style girl groups influenced by burlesque dance. Thus, groups such as Kitty Girls, Mocha Girls and P.Y.T. were formed.<p>

<p>Pinoy pop renaissance (2010s)
Since 2010, the genre of Pinoy pop drastically changed as the usual rock bands from the 1990s and 2000s started to fade out of the mainstream, creating the new pop genre without any influence of rock and hip-hop.</p>

<p>Notable pop artists of the 2010s include James Reid, Yassi Pressman, Julie Anne San Jose, Nadine Lustre, Sam Concepcion and Elmo Magalona.</p>
